# React-Tic-Tac-Toe

My first game made using React:

Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.  The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across or diagonally) is the winner.  When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.  If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
